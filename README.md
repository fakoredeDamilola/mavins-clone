## PROJECT PURPOSE AND GOAL

When I saw the website, my plan initally was to clone it to see how good I was with building fully functioning website. Along the way I felt there were things I could add to improve this website, one of them was the custom cursor I created.

## LESSON LEARNT

This project opened my eye to how to organize my code, especially my stylesheet. I made sure not to check their code until I completed and deployed mine. I also tried has much has possible not to use the name of the artistes and picture (that is why you have lot of lorem text and random pictures).

From this project, I learnt how to create a [custom mouse](https://dev.to/fakorededamilola/creating-a-custom-cursor-using-css-1io6). I also learnt how to create that cool text animation you see when you open the home page.
